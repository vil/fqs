# fqs
Fedora Quick Start script - Finish your post installation steps easily.

Made this for myself, but I'll upload it here for everyone if someone else wants to use it `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Run
You can run this script simply with one line without installing anything:

`sh -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vil/fqs/master/fqs)"`

Or you can follow the installation steps below.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/vil/fqs.git`
2. Make the script runnable `chmod +x fqs`
3. Change to root `su`
4. Run the script `./fqs`
