# fqs
Fedora Quick Start script - Finish your post installation steps easily.

Made this for myself, but I'll upload it here for everyone if someone else wants to use it `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Run
You can run this script simply with one line without installing anything:

`sh -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vil/fqs/master/fqs)"`

Or you can follow the installation steps below.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/vil/fqs.git`
2. Make the script runnable `chmod +x fqs`
3. Run the script with sudo permissions `./fqs`

Avoid running this as the **root** user nor with **sudo**, otherwise oh-my-zsh will install on the root account which is bad.

## Contributing
If you are a Fedora user and want to improve this, just feel free to open up a pull request :)
